# Awscloudtrail

AWS api log will go in cloudtrail and we need to pull these log from cloudtrail to in ELKStack Analytics Enviorment.
How can i achieve these stuff?

1:-  we need to create S3 bucket for cloudtrail log 

2:-  These cloutrail log will export in S3 bucket which i have created

3:-  then we should give the permission on that IAM user whoch i have allow the access for these Cloudtrail S3 bucket.

4:-  After that we need to install AWS ClI or S3cmd in my Local machine or ELK Stack Enviorment.

5:-  We need to connectvity from ELKStack to Cloudtrail S3 Bucket (If your ELK is runnign on the same AWS tenent then we should connect local or if your ELK is running different enviormemt like your own cloud like (Pvt Cloud Openstack) then you access via Internet Proxy which is used by your DevOps Team.

6:-  Then ned to install S3cmd and configure the access key, Secret key, region (s3 bucket resgion) and Proxy details woth ports.

7:-  we need to create script for pull the data from Cloudtrail S3 bucket to your premises

8:-  MOst Important thing which is regarding for Cloudtrail Log becasue cloudtrail log format is json and we need to same thing in your env then you should have any parser or batch file like JQ.

9:- you should install JQ (Java query) in your logstash then no need to write parser etc in your logstash node as input for pull the data from your node which have s3cmd and JQ.

Encryption password is used to protect your files from reading
by unauthorized persons while in transfer to S3
Encryption password: xxxxxxxxxx
Path to GPG program [/usr/bin/gpg]:

When using secure HTTPS protocol all communication with Amazon S3
servers is protected from 3rd party eavesdropping. This method is
slower than plain HTTP and can't be used if you're behind a proxy
Use HTTPS protocol [No]: Yes

New settings:
  Access Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  Secret Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  Encryption password: xxxxxxxxxx
  Path to GPG program: /usr/bin/gpg
  Use HTTPS protocol: True
  HTTP Proxy server name:
  HTTP Proxy server port: 0

Test access with supplied credentials? [Y/n] Y
Please wait, attempting to list all buckets...
Success. Your access key and secret key worked fine :-)

Now verifying that encryption works...
Success. Encryption and decryption worked fine :-)

Save settings? [y/N] y

Uses of s3cmd Command Line
------------------------------------------------------

Once configuration is successfully completed. Now find below command details to how to manage s3 buckets using commands.

1. List All S3 Bucket 

Use following command to list all s3 buckets in your aws account.

# s3cmd ls

2. Creating New Bucket

To create a new bucket in Amazon s3 use below command. It will create bucket named delta in S3 account.

# s3cmd mb s3://delta

Bucket 's3://delta/' created

3. Uploading file in Bucket

Below command will upload file test.txt to s3 bucket using s3cmd command.

# s3cmd put file.txt s3://tecadmin/

file.txt -> s3://delta/test.txt  [1 of 1]
 70119 of 70119   100% in    0s  976.82 kB/s  done
 
 4. Uploading Directory in Bucket

If we need to upload entire directory use -r to upload it recursively like below.

# s3cmd put -r backup s3://delta/

backup/test.txt -> s3://delta/backup/test.txt  [1 of 2]
 9876 of 9876  100% in    0s    12.98 kB/s  done
backup/test1.txt -> s3://delta/backup/test1.txt  [2 of 2]
 0 of 0     0% in    0s     0.00 B/s  done
 
 Make sure you are not adding trailing slash/ in upload directory named backup (eg: backup/), else it will upload only content of backup directory only.
 
 # s3cmd put -r backup/ s3://delta/

backup/test.txt -> s3://delta/test.txt  [1 of 2]
70119 of 70119   100% in    0s    12.98 kB/s  done
backup/test1.txt -> s3://delta/test1.txt  [2 of 2]
 0 of 0     0% in    0s     0.00 B/s  done
